Made in Processing

Allows sets of points to be chosen from the display and saved to a text file.
Points are saved as "x1 y1, x2 y2, ..." with each set on a new line.
Coordinates are saved as mouseX/width and mouseY/height.

Click to add point to current set, press n to start a new set and s to save to file.

### TODO
- make sets of points more distinctive 
- allow the user to change the active set of points to add to
